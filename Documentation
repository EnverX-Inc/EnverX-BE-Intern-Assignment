### Architecture
1.Followed MVC architecture for project structure
routes: contains all the routes, routes are used to define the routes, bascially the url
controllers: contains all the controllers, controllers are used to handle the request and response, bascially the logic
models: contains all the models, like here i have created the post model, if you want to add more options you can add it here and handle it from its controller

2.Followed REST API architecture for API structure


### Database
MongoDB Atlas is used to store the data as it is a cloud database service and can be used from anywhere
